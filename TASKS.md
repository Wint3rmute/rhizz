# Implementation Tasks

How to work on this file:

- Read the next task
- Implement it, use red/green TDD
- Run tests & linters (`cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo doc`, `cargo build`) until it's all working
- Once all linters/builds/tests pass, run `cargo fmt`
- Delete the task from the file once done, report that you're finished

## Task 18 — Spec v0.3: Migrate rhizz-cli and rhizz-gui frontends

### rhizz-cli

- Update `ScoreReport` display: show `Ports` and `Connections` rows instead of `Interfaces`
- Update JSON output `score` object: replace `"interfaces"` with `"ports"` and `"connections"` keys
- Update human-readable diagnostic examples if any are hardcoded
- Update CLI tests (16 tests)

### rhizz-gui

- Sidebar tree: replace interface listing with connections listing; optionally show ports under each component
- Any references to `model.interfaces` → `model.connections`
- Update GUI tests (5 tests)

Run: `cargo test --all`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo doc`, `cargo build`, `cargo fmt`

## Task 19 — Task template

- When a tab is selected, call `rhizz_dot::render_view` to get the DOT string, then pass it to the `layout` crate to compute node positions.
- Draw nodes and edges with `egui::Painter` inside a `ScrollArea` (pan via scroll, no zoom required for the prototype).
- Leaf components → solid-border box; non-leaf components → dashed-border cluster rectangle containing their children; unidirectional interface → arrow; bidirectional → plain line.
- `cargo build`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt` must all pass.
