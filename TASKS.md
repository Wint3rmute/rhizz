# Implementation Tasks

How to work on this file:

- Read the next task from this file
- Get extra context from recently finished tasks - read the first 50 lines of
  `FINISHED_TASKS.md`
- Implement the task, use red/green TDD
- Run tests & linters (`cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo doc`, `cargo build`)
  until it's all working
- Once all linters/builds/tests pass, run `cargo fmt`
- Move the completed task to `FINISHED_TASKS.md` and report that you're finished

## Task 53 - pin existing nodes when auto-laying-out newly-added ones

Split out from Task 50 (now finished — see `FINISHED_TASKS.md`) as the one
remaining concrete piece of its original scope. `forceLayout.ts` already
supports pinning a node in place via `fixed: true` on a `LayoutNode` (sets
d3-force's `fx`/`fy`, ignored by all forces) — added specifically for this
case, but nothing calls it that way yet.

- When a component is checked onto the canvas (the sidebar checkbox's
  "check" branch), instead of just placing it at a default/remembered
  position, run a force-layout pass where every *other* currently-placed
  sibling is `fixed: true` and only the newly-checked node is free to
  move — so it settles into whatever gap is available near its
  connections, without visibly disturbing anything else already placed.
- Needs a concrete trigger decision: should this replace the current
  "restore remembered position, or default to (100, 100)" behavior
  unconditionally, or only when there's no remembered position to
  restore (i.e. first-time placement only, not re-checking something
  that was previously positioned)? Lean towards the latter — respecting
  a remembered position take priority over auto-placing.
- Validate with `deno task check`, `deno task build`, `deno task test`.

## (For later brainstorming) Task <N> - virtual filesystem hierarchy for frontend

High-level goal: make it possible to store multiple multi-file projects & diagrams,
with the web application pretending to have a virtual filesystem hierarchy.

## (For later brainstorming) Task <N> - visual regression testing

As we now have a virtual filesystem hierarchy for the frontend, we can create
end-to-end tests which load the project, render a diagram and verify that it
matches the expected output.

Vitest supports visual regression testing. The goal of this task is to implement
infrastructure for visual regression testing in the frontend, then ask the
developer to create diagrams, which can be saved as reference images for future
comparisons.


## Task <NUMBER> — Task template

- Task description here
- Requirements, spec, acceptance criteria as bullet points
- Keep on increasing the task ID when creating new tasks
- Don't remove this template, move it to the bottom instead
