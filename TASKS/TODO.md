# Tasks

How to work on this file:

- Read the next task from this file
- Get extra context from recently finished tasks - read the first 50 lines of
  `TASKS/FINISHED.md`
- If on `main`, switch to a new feature branch
- Implement the task, use red/green TDD
- Run tests & linters (`just test`, `just lint`, `just build`)
  until it's all working
- Once all linters/builds/tests pass, run `cargo fmt`
- Move the completed task to `FINISHED.md` and report that you're finished

## Task <N> - write documentation directly from the Inventory page.

Currently, the inventory page displays a tabbed bottom section, with: "full name", "ports", "requirements" and "metadata".

Change how "full name" works - instead of displaying the full_name field of the
component, it should describe component's documentation - what's located in
`docs/<component_name>.md`. There should be a button to switch from a
markdown-based viewer to a plain multiline editor.

Re-use the Markdown renderer from the /explore page, which already renders
markdown. If needed, extract to a common renderer.

## Task <N> - implement a righ-click context menu for the canvas in /modeling

All components in the canvas shall have a right-click listener. The contents of the 
context menu will vary depending on what's clicked.

### General rules

- For each item in the context menu, description of that action (e.g. delete) shall be on the left side of the item row
- The keyboard shortcut for each item shall be displayed on the right side of the item row (e.g. a slightly greyed-out "D")
- Suggest shortcuts based on first letters of the action description

### Component context menu

Component's context menu shall feature:

- Delete
- Jump to documentation
- Jump to detailed view
- Hide

### Annotation context menu

Annotation's context menu shall feature:

- Delete

### Connection context menu

Connection's context menu shall feature:

- Delete

### Context menu when clicked on an empty space

- New component
- New annotation
- Zoom to fill
- Reset view
- Toggle grid

## Task <N> - more advanced connection routing on canvas

Currently, the connections are always routed using a "double-knee" approach,
with 2 turning points on each connection. This does not always work.

Think about existing well-thought solutions to structuring connections in such
diagram editors and suggest a more flexible option, which will smartly figure
out whether to use connections with 2 turning points or just a single turning
point.

## Task <N> — Detect isolated component trees in systems

It is possible to define a system with 2 completely independent component trees,
You can verify that empirically. This is not a correct behavior, since it means
that the user has effectively defined 2 separate systems and shoved them into one.
While this is not an error, it should emit a warning.

Definition of done:

1. Add a new warning "Multiple isolated component trees found in system <name>".
2. Use some graph algorithm to walk the system model and detect "isolated trees".
3. Write tests for this feature.

Extra: Can you find any human-readable way to inform the user where they should
look to find the isolated system subtree? Just bare "multiple component trees"
detected is not very informative, although at this point I've no idea how to
point the user towards resolving their issue.

## Task <N> — Modular multi-pane workspace with shared reactive context

Refactor the web architecture from isolated page routes to a unified, dockable multi-pane workspace where multiple synchronized views (Editor, Diagrams, Explore, Diagnostics) operate concurrently on a shared reactive data model.

- **Strategy**
  - Hoist project file and compiled model state into a shared reactive context (`ProjectWorkspaceContext.svelte.ts`) at the project layout root.
  - Decouple view pages into standalone, embeddable pane components (`<EditorPane />`, `<DiagramPane />`, `<ExplorePane />`, `<DiagnosticsPane />`).
  - Introduce a configurable split/tiling layout container supporting resizable horizontal and vertical panes.
- **Implementation Scope**
  - **Shared Reactive State:** Single source of truth for VFS `sources`, WASM compilation outputs, diagnostics, and transaction history. Edits in any pane immediately update the reactive model and notify all sibling panes.
  - **Pane Components:** Extract view logic from `routes/projects/[id]/*` into standalone modular components.
  - **Layout Manager:** Implement a dockable/splittable window layout container (supporting tabs, 2-column split, 3-column split, grid) with persistent layout configuration in localStorage.
- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - User can display the Code Editor and Diagram Canvas side-by-side simultaneously.
  - Editing HCL text in the Editor pane updates the rendered diagram in real-time.
  - Creating/moving components in the Diagram pane updates the text in the open Editor pane without cursor jump or desynchronization.
  - Panes can be resized, split horizontally/vertically, and closed.
  - Layout configuration persists across page reloads.
  - Validated with `just test`, `just lint`, and `just build`.

## (For later brainstorming) Task <N> - pin existing nodes when auto-laying-out newly-added ones

Split out from Task 50 (now finished — see `FINISHED.md`) as the one
remaining concrete piece of its original scope. `forceLayout.ts` already
supports pinning a node in place via `fixed: true` on a `LayoutNode` (sets
d3-force's `fx`/`fy`, ignored by all forces) — added specifically for this
case, but nothing calls it that way yet.

- When a component is checked onto the canvas (the sidebar checkbox's
  "check" branch), instead of just placing it at a default/remembered
  position, run a force-layout pass where every *other* currently-placed
  sibling is `fixed: true` and only the newly-checked node is free to
  move — so it settles into whatever gap is available near its
  connections, without visibly disturbing anything else already placed.
- Needs a concrete trigger decision: should this replace the current
  "restore remembered position, or default to (100, 100)" behavior
  unconditionally, or only when there's no remembered position to
  restore (i.e. first-time placement only, not re-checking something
  that was previously positioned)? Lean towards the latter — respecting
  a remembered position take priority over auto-placing.
- Validate with `deno task check`, `deno task build`, `deno task test`.

## (For later brainstorming) Task <N> - routing multiple connections between 2 components

When 2 components have more than one connection between them, connection routing
rules cause connections to be drawn over each other. Instead, a better routing algorithm should be implemented.
I'm thinking about a PCB-style routing that lines up multiple connections along a shared path, but with some extra
offset to avoid overlapping.

## (For later brainstorming) Task <N> - when adding a new node - place it in the center of the viewport

As in the title. Position of the node is persisted across deletes, so it can
be "brought back" into the same position as it was before, but only if it was
in the diagram before! For completely new nodes, they always appear in a fixed
place in the diagram. This is cumbersome, as the user might not have that part
of the diagram in their viewport, which might make them think that nothing
happened.

Definition of done:

- If a new element is added to the diagram, this element is placed at the center of the viewport by default

---

## (For later) Task <N> — Allow for panning & zooming in the Explore view

Currently, only the Diagrams page allows panning & zooming. I want to extract
this feature and make it possible to pan & zoom in other pages:

- Explore
- Inventory
- Embedded diagrams viewer

Definition of done:

- Panning & zooming is clearly extracted, ideally as a reusable system
- Panning & zooming now works in Explore/Inventory/Embedded diagrams viewer

## (For later brainstorming) Task <N> - visual regression testing

As we now have a virtual filesystem hierarchy for the frontend, we can create
end-to-end tests which load the project, render a diagram and verify that it
matches the expected output.

Vitest supports visual regression testing. The goal of this task is to implement
infrastructure for visual regression testing in the frontend, then ask the
developer to create diagrams, which can be saved as reference images for future
comparisons.

---

## (For later) Task <N> — Multi-file workspace tabs and project import/export

Add a unified workspace view that lets users inspect the generated `system.hcl` and `views.hcl` files side-by-side with the visual canvas, and import/export projects.

- Tabbed workspace switcher:
  - "Canvas" (interactive visual modeler, default)
  - "system.hcl" (live code viewer / editor for the core architectural model)
  - "views.hcl" (live code viewer / editor for layout coordinates and view filters)
- File Import / Export:
  - "Export Project" downloads `system.hcl` and `views.hcl`.
  - "Open / Import" loads existing `.hcl` files into the GUI and auto-populates the visual model.
- Validate with `deno task check`, `deno task test`, `deno task build`.
